       <p> 
        Hello everyone, my name is Zantana Kahsay.I am 20 years old, and I am currently an emerging professional enrolled at year up and taking class through Seattle Central.
         I took some computer programing language class before.So, I can say I have a bit of understanding on it.
       </p>
       <p>
        My name is Zantana Kahsay, I was born and raised in Ethiopia. Growing up, I had the aspiration to become one of the few people that make the best out of their life in my country. 
        Being born from a working-class family in a way was a great opportunity not many are able to enjoy in Africa. Whereas my interest to pursue technological studies was already dead on arrival as there are few to no opportunities in science and technology in Ethiopia.
         In the contrary, though life in its own was a challenge for them, my parents tried their best to fulfill my needs. My father even in hope of providing me a better future enrolled me in a coding training programs in Ethiopia.
         It is one of the very few and rare programs to find as only two or three training centers were available for the whole country.
       </p>
       <p>
        I love working with computers. I believe my strongest trait is I am a fast learner.
